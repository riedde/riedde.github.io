# personal-website
This is the source code of the personal website of Dennis Ried.

The [former website](https://github.com/riedde/homepageDR) was designed as an application for [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org). The [content](https://github.com/riedde/homepageDRContent) rendered by the application, was encoded in TEI-XML.
This infrastructure was nice, but won't be developed anymore because it is not as easy to handle as a static webpage. In fact, the result was generated dynamically but there wasn't a bigger benefit. So the source coude an the data have been archived and this repository was created.
